      "   The TCP MD5 Signature (TCP MD5) is a TCP option that authenticates\n",
      "   TCP segments, including the TCP IPv4 pseudoheader, TCP header, and\n",
      "   TCP data.  It was developed to protect BGP sessions from spoofed TCP\n",
      "   segments, which could affect BGP data or the robustness of the TCP\n",
      "   connection itself [RFC2385][RFC4953].\n",
      "\n",
      "   There have been many recent concerns about TCP MD5.  Its use of a\n",
      "   simple keyed hash for authentication is problematic because there\n",
      "   have been escalating attacks on the algorithm itself [Wa05].  TCP MD5\n",
      "   also lacks both key-management and algorithm agility.  This document\n",
      "   adds the latter, and provides a simple key coordination mechanism\n",
      "   giving the ability to move from one key to another within the same\n",
      "   connection.  It does not however provide for complete cryptographic\n",
      "   key management to be handled in band of TCP, because TCP SYN segments\n",
      "   lack sufficient remaining space to handle such a negotiation (see\n",
      "   Section 7.6).  This document obsoletes the TCP MD5 option with a more\n",
      "   general TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO).  This new option supports\n",
      "   the use of other, stronger hash functions, provides replay protection\n",
      "   for long-lived connections and across repeated instances of a single\n",
      "   connection, coordinates key changes between endpoints, and provides a\n",
      "   more explicit recommendation for external key management.  The result\n",
      "   is compatible with IPv6, and is fully compatible with proposed\n",
      "   requirements for a replacement for TCP MD5 [Ed07].\n",
      "\n",
      "   TCP-AO obsoletes TCP MD5, although a particular implementation may\n",

      "   performance.  Connections that are known to use TCP-AO can be\n",
      "   attacked by transmitting segments with invalid MACs.  Attackers would\n",
      "   need to know only the TCP connection ID and TCP-AO Length value to\n",
      "   substantially impact the host's processing capacity.  This is similar\n",
      "   to the susceptibility of IPsec to on-path attacks, where the IP\n",
      "   addresses and SPI would be visible.  For IPsec, the entire SPI space\n",
      "   (32 bits) is arbitrary, whereas for routing protocols typically only\n",
      "   the source port (16 bits) is arbitrary (typically with less than 16\n",
      "   bits of randomness [La10]).  As a result, it would be easier for an\n",
      "   off-path attacker to spoof a TCP-AO segment that could cause receiver\n",
      "   validation effort.  However, we note that between Internet routers,\n",
      "   both ports could be arbitrary (i.e., determined a priori out of\n",
      "   band), which would constitute roughly the same off-path antispoofing\n",
      "   protection of an arbitrary SPI.\n",
      "\n",
      "   TCP-AO, like TCP MD5, may inhibit connectionless resets.  Such resets\n",
      "   typically occur after peer crashes, either in response to new\n",
      "   connection attempts or when data is sent on stale connections; in\n",
      "   either case, the recovering endpoint may lack the connection key\n",
      "   required (e.g., if lost during the crash).  This may result in\n",
      "   timeouts, rather than a more responsive recovery after such a crash.\n",
      "   Recommendations for mitigating this effect are discussed in Section\n",
      "   7.7.\n",
      "\n",
      "   TCP-AO does not include a fast decline capability, e.g., where a SYN-\n",
      "   ACK is received without an expected TCP-AO and the connection is\n",
      "   quickly reset or aborted.  Normal TCP operation will retry and\n",
      "   timeout, which is what should be expected when the intended receiver\n",
      "   is not capable of the TCP variant required anyway.  Backoff is not\n",
      "   optimized because it would present an opportunity for attackers on\n",
      "   the wire to abort authenticated connection attempts by sending\n",
      "   spoofed SYN-ACKs without TCP-AO.\n",
      "\n",
      "   TCP-AO is intended to provide similar protections to IPsec, but is\n",
      "   not intended to replace the use of IPsec or IKE either for more\n",
      "   robust security or more sophisticated security management.  TCP-AO is\n",
      "   intended to protect the TCP protocol itself from attacks that TLS,\n",
      "   sBGP/soBGP, and other data stream protection mechanisms cannot.  Like\n",
      "   IPsec, TCP-AO does not address the overall issue of ICMP attacks on\n",
      "   TCP, but does limit the impact of ICMPs, as noted in Section 7.8.\n",
      "\n",
      "   TCP-AO includes the TCP connection ID (the socket pair) in the MAC\n",
      "   calculation.  This prevents different concurrent connections using\n",
      "   the same MKT (for whatever reason) from potentially enabling a\n",
      "   traffic-crossing attack, in which segments to one socket pair are\n",
      "   diverted to attack a different socket pair.  When multiple\n",
      "   connections use the same MKT, it would be useful to know that\n",
      "   segments intended for one ID could not be (maliciously or otherwise)\n",
      "   modified in transit and end up being authenticated for the other ID.\n",
      "   That requirement would place an additional burden of uniqueness on\n",
      "   MKTs within endsystems, and potentially across endsystems.  Although\n",
      "   the resulting attack is low probability, the protection afforded by\n",
      "   including the received ID warrants its inclusion in the MAC, and does\n",
      "   not unduly increase the MAC calculation or MKT management.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The use of any security algorithm can present an opportunity for a\n",
      "   CPU Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, where the attacker sends false,\n",
      "   random segments that the receiver under attack expends substantial\n",
      "   CPU effort to reject.  In IPsec, such attacks are reduced by the use\n",
      "   of a large Security Parameter Index (SPI) and Sequence Number fields\n",
      "   to partly validate segments before CPU cycles are invested validated\n",
      "   the Integrity Check Value (ICV).  In TCP-AO, the socket pair performs\n",
      "   most of the function of IPsec's SPI, and IPsec's Sequence Number,\n",
      "   used to avoid replay attacks, isn't needed due to TCP's Sequence\n",
      "   Number, which is used to reorder received segments (provided the\n",
      "   sequence number doesn't wrap around, which is why TCP-AO adds the SNE\n",

      "   authentic segment data as well as authentic explicit TCP control\n",
      "   (e.g., SYN, FIN, ACK bits) but even authentic replays could affect\n",
      "   TCP congestion control [Sa99].  TCP-AO does not protect TCP\n",

      "   cumbersome nature of layering a windowed security sequence number\n",
      "   within TCP in addition to TCP's own sequence number; when such\n",
      "   protection is desired, users are encouraged to apply IPsec instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Further, it is not useful to validate TCP's Sequence Number before\n",
      "   performing a TCP-AO authentication calculation, because out-of-window\n",
      "   segments can still cause valid TCP protocol actions (e.g., ACK\n",
